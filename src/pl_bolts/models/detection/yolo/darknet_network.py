    Iterates through the layers from the configuration and creates corresponding PyTorch modules. If ``weights_path`` is
    given and points to a Darknet model file, loads the convolutional layer weights from the file.

    Args:
        config_path: Path to a Darknet configuration file that defines the network architecture.
        weights_path: Path to a Darknet model file. If given, the model weights will be read from this file.
        in_channels: Number of channels in the input image.
        matching_algorithm: Which algorithm to use for matching targets to anchors. "simota" (the SimOTA matching rule
            from YOLOX), "size" (match those prior shapes, whose width and height relative to the target is below given
            ratio), "iou" (match all prior shapes that give a high enough IoU), or "maxiou" (match the prior shape that
            gives the highest IoU, default).
        matching_threshold: Threshold for "size" and "iou" matching algorithms.
        spatial_range: The "simota" matching algorithm will restrict to anchors that are within an `N Ã— N` grid cell
            area centered at the target, where `N` is the value of this parameter.
        size_range: The "simota" matching algorithm will restrict to anchors whose dimensions are no more than `N` and
            no less than `1/N` times the target dimensions, where `N` is the value of this parameter.
        ignore_bg_threshold: If a predictor is not responsible for predicting any target, but the corresponding anchor
            has IoU with some target greater than this threshold, the predictor will not be taken into account when
            calculating the confidence loss.
        overlap_func: A function for calculating the pairwise overlaps between two sets of boxes. Either a string or a
            function that returns a matrix of pairwise overlaps. Valid string values are "iou", "giou", "diou", and
            "ciou".
        predict_overlap: Balance between binary confidence targets and predicting the overlap. 0.0 means that the target
            confidence is 1 if there's an object, and 1.0 means that the target confidence is the output of
            ``overlap_func``.
        label_smoothing: The epsilon parameter (weight) for class label smoothing. 0.0 means no smoothing (binary
            targets), and 1.0 means that the target probabilities are always 0.5.
        overlap_loss_multiplier: Overlap loss will be scaled by this value.
        confidence_loss_multiplier: Confidence loss will be scaled by this value.
        class_loss_multiplier: Classification loss will be scaled by this value.
